When a couple gets together, it's never just the two of them - they also bring baggage - and Susan and Steve are no exception. Their baggage is a crowd of best friends and exes who talk about all aspects of sex and relationships on their never-ending quest to find true love. Perhaps, perhaps, perhaps... Susan Walker is a beautiful go-getter with an uninhibited attitude who used to date Patrick Maitland, the sextet's charismatic, cocky player, London's king of conquests - a guy who's just too cool to worry about being smart. Attractive Sally Harper is a beauty therapist who is Susan's unashamedly vain best friend, who aggressively battles aging with heavy doses of moisturizer and men - including Patrick. Meanwhile, Steve Taylor, while getting together with Susan, can't seem to shake loose from his vivacious and slightly vacuous ex-girlfriend Jane Christie, a woman supremely confident in her ability to seduce anyone of either sex, and who refuses to be dumped unless she's the one doing the dumping. Jeff Murdoch is Steve's \"porn buddy\" who is, in equal parts, obsessed and bewildered by actual sex; charming in his way, but with an uncanny ability to say the wrong thing at the worst possible time. He works in the same office as Susan, with whom he had a disastrous and unsuccessful one-night fling. Coupling has been honoured with the prestigious Silver Rose of Montreux, Best TV Comedy Award, and is recent winner at the 2003 British Comedy Awards.

At the end of last season Susan and Steve discovered they were pregnant (well, mostly Susan), confirmed bachelor Patrick and Sally finally admitted their true feelings for each other, and poor Jane was left on her own, once again. But it's not all doom and gloom for Jane. As the new season opens, things are looking up. There's this guy called Oliver, who has his eye on her. Is it possible that lifetime loser in love Oliver might just get somewhere with lifetime loser in love Jane? Trouble is, his apartment is a little \"un-edited\" and his living room has lost the battle with magazine nudity... Susan and Steve are now well and truly an item. So why is he dreaming about being executed by a fetus with an axe? Meanwhile Sally and Patrick are settling into their new relationship. But since the dawn of time, men and women have been falling in love - and men have been trying to get home straight afterwards.

Edward Elric and his younger brother Alphonse were living quite happily with their mother. So Edward and Alphonse decided to try to raise her from the dead. The resurrection failed, leaving Edward without an arm and a leg and Alphonse's soul attached to a suit of armor. Now they roam around the country trying to find a way to restore their bodies. After their mother's death, Edward Elric and his younger brother, Alphonse, try using alchemy to bring her back to life. Unfortunately they do not fully take into account the law of equivalent exchange which requires a sacrifice of equal value to what one hopes to achieve. Not only do they fail to revive their mother but Edward loses an arm and a leg and Alphonse loses his entire body, forcing his soul to remain confined to an empty suit of armor. Seeking a way to restore their bodies, Edward becomes a state alchemist and the brothers begin a long search for the legendary Philosopher's Stone, an object purported to allow its users to ignore the law of equivalent exchange. The Elric brothers' deciding to perform a forbidden human transmutation to bring their dead mother back, they end up losing their bodies. Now Edward must find the chemical privileges to restore their body back.", "hasGenre": ["Animation", "Action", "Adventure", "Comedy", "Drama", "Fantasy", "Sci-Fi"], "hasRuntime": 24}, "ts0380136": {"hasSeasonYears": "2003-", "hasTitle": "QI", "hasNumberSeasons": 13, "hasCover": "http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BMTMwMDUyMzA1OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzg0MTA0MQ@@._V1._CR16,3,310,435._SX100_SY140_.jpg", "hasID": "ts0380136", "hasRating": 8.8, "hasPlot": "A comedy panel game in which being Quite Interesting is more important than being right.

It addresses issues such as personal identity and freedom, democracy, education, scientific progress, art and technology, while still remaining an entertaining drama series. Over seventeen episodes we witness a war of attrition between the faceless forces behind 'The Village' (a Kafkaesque community somewhere between Butlins and Alcatraz) and its most strong willed inmate, No. 6. who struggles ceaselessly to assert his individuality while plotting to escape from his captors. A high-ranking but un-named Agent in the British Government resigns from his job/post and leaves for a holiday. While packing he is gassed and is taken to a beautiful but deadly prison known only as \"The Village\" where people are taken, given a Number to be called by and kept there for the rest of their lives if they don't tell No. 2 (the deputy head of \"The Village\") the information they are captured for. Escape is nearly impossible as \"The Village\" has amazing but deadly weapons to use if anybody tries to escape. The Agent is given the title of \"No. 6\" but he adopts the name of \"The Prisoner\". The series tells of his attempts to resist the plots of each No. 2 (who is replaced with another if an attempt on No. 6 fails) to get his information and against any attempt to disrupt the nearly peaceful running of the \"The Village\". The Village is determined to crack The Prisoner by attempting to get the answer to why he resigned from his job/post. As time goes on, two questions plague The Prisoner's mind - How can he escape and who is the real leader of the Village - the mysterious No. 1?. A man who drives a 60's Lotus sports car around London resigns from a Top secret job. We next see him packing for a holiday at home, and a credit appears ... \"The Prisoner\". He is gassed, falls asleep and then wakes up in \"The Village\". Everyone in \"The Village\" is a number, and is there for security reasons (people to dangerous and who hold too much information to just let go). The series spends all its time trying to get the \"information\" out of No.6 about why he resigned. Plus it spends quite a while chasing him with a weather balloon :-) A strange cult UK TV series. After resigning, a secret agent is abducted and taken to what looks like an idyllic village, but is really a bizarre prison. His warders demand information.

Now in his second marriage to his gorgeous young wife, Gloria, Jay has been given something of a second chance. Still, old habits are hard to break, and it's trial by fire as he tries to adapt to life with the same passion and vigor that Gloria exhibits, which are matched by her precocious 12-year-old son, Manny. There are some culture clashes, a few misunderstandings, but also plenty of sweet victories along the way. Jay's grown daughter, Claire, and her husband, Phil, are the proud parents of three kids with whom they want that open, healthy, honest relationship. It's not always easy, especially when you have Haley, a teenage daughter who's growing up a little fast, Alex, a too-smart-for-her-own-good middle daughter and Luke, a scatterbrained boy. Add to this that Phil is just a big kid himself, even if he does always have the best intentions. Claire is the anchor, trying her best to run a tight ship and determined not to let her kids have the rebellious childhood she had. Claire's brother and Jay's grown son, Mitchell, is busy raising an adopted daughter, Lily, with his long term partner, Cameron.

Finch discovered that the machine sees everything, potential terrorist acts and violent crimes that involve ordinary people. When the government considered violent crimes between normal people \"irrelevant\", Finch built a back door into the system that gives him the social security number of a person involved in a future violent crime so he could act. Partnered with John Reese, an ex-CIA agent, the two work in secret to prevent violent crimes before they can happen. Eventually their activities lead to being hunted by the New York Police Department, CIA Agents in pursuit of Reese who was listed as dead, a computer hacker named Root who wants access to the Machine, and government officials who want to keep all knowledge of the Machine a complete secret. Wealthy genius software engineer, who generally goes by the name Harold Finch, is the mastermind behind the creation of an all-seeing machine. Finch and his front man Nathan Ingram devised the machine to sell to the US government, who are unaware of Finch working behind the scenes. The purpose of the machine is so that the government can spot acts leading to terrorism to prevent those terrorist acts from occurring. But what the government considers irrelevant in its use of the machine are acts leading to murder. As such, Finch, without the government's knowledge that he has a back door to the machine, wants to prevent those murders. The machine only provides the social security number of someone involved, Finch unaware if that person is the target or perpetrator. He enlists the help of an ex-CIA special operative who generally goes by the name John Reese to assist in his mission, Reese who is officially listed as dead. But as Reese in particular often uses non-legal means to achieve Finch's end goal, he is tracked by the authorities, who only know him as the man in the suit. They are also tracked by those who are thwarted by the pair in carrying out this mission, and by the few who know of the machine's existence and who have their own nefarious thoughts of what to do with the machine if they can gets their hands on it. After the 9/11 terrorist attacks, a wealth billionaire software engineer & genius, who generally goes by the name Harold Finch, created a Machine that is an all-seeing Supercomputer designed to detect acts of terror before they can happen. The Supercomputer simply called \"The Machine\" can monitor the entire world through every cell-phone, email and surveillance camera. Finch and best friend Nathan Ingram devised the machine to sell to the US government, using Ingrams own company IFT in New York. The 2 made a deal that keeps Finch's animosity while Ingram acts as a front man so the government are unaware of Finch working behind the scenes. The purpose of the machine is so that the government can spot acts leading to terrorism and stop them before they can act but Finch discovered that the machine sees everything, potential terrorist acts and violent crimes that involve ordinary people. When the government considered violent crimes between normal people \"irrelevant\", Ingram's becomes guilt ridden and builds a back-door into the system that gives him the social security number of a person involved in a future violent crime so he could act. Soon Finch finds out about what Nathan has been doing and is angry that Nathan is putting the project in jeopardy, so they fight. Nathan reveals he has decided to go public and tell the world about what he and Finch have done. However the government finds out and just before Finch turned of a computer screen, Ingram's picture pops-up but Finch does not see it. Before he can talk to a reporter the government stages a terrorist attack on a New York ferry. Ingram and the reporter are killed and Finch (whom turned up to see Ingram) ends up partially paralyze and goes into hiding, even from his fiance Grace Hendrix, whom the Machine itself had picked out as perfect match for Finch. Finch finds out the Machine knew about Ingram being a target and so changes his mind about helping the potential victims. Flashforward a few years and Finch enlists the help of an ex-CIA special operative who generally goes by the name John Reese to assist in his mission, Reese who is officially listed as dead after the CIA betrayed him. Reese blames himself for the death of the love of his life, Jessica Arndt, who is killed by her abusive husband, whom she married after Reese pushed her away to rein-list in the Army after the 9/11 attacks. Reese had gone on a suicidal path before Finch found him in the gutter, and gives him a purpose. Together the pair attempt to stop violent crimes before they can happen. Reese initially uses a corrupt cop called Lionel Fusco whom he coerces into helping him track down leads involving the Persons of Interests and soon Fusco starts to redeem himself of his own free will.

She begins to have doubts after one of her targets proves to be an engineer working for the government; the assassination is part of the cover-up that conceals the existence of The Machine. As a result, her partner is killed and she becomes a number. Reese and Finch save her life and she subsequently works for them on a regular basis.

He always seems to have his hands full: He's having affairs with most of his waitresses, he's keeping his wife happy, he's trying to please the German soldiers who frequent his caf, and he's running a major underground operation for the Resistance. Quite often, the Germans' incompetence itself is what nearly lands Ren and his cohorts in hot water; they are not helped either by the locals, who are dreadfully keen to get rid of the Germans, but their blatant and theatrical attempts at espionage and secrecy often create problems that Ren must solve quickly. Ren Artois is the owner and manager of a caf in German-occupied France of World War II. To look at him, it's hard to believe that some women find him irresistible, something he has to work hard to hide from his wife Edith. Ren's caf, frequented by both the German military and the French resistance, is the focal point for the show. Ren's a bit of a coward and is stuck in the middle, trying to humor both sides. Hidden in the caf are two English airmen who don't understand a word of French. Other characters include Lt. Gruber, a homosexual German tank driver; Otto Flick, the evil SS officer who is always outsmarted; and Engelbert von Smallhausen, his small sidekick. Ren's not the only coward in town: Captain Hans Geering and Colonel Kurt von Strohm are constantly on the defensive, along with Captain Alberto Bertorelli of the Italian army who has a medal for servicing Fiats. Much of the farce comes from Officer Crabtree, an British agent disguised as a French policeman with a poor grasp of \"Zee Fronch Linguige,\" and from Ren's amorous waitresses, Mimi, Yvette, and Maria. In this spoof of World War II, Ren Artois runs a caf in German-occupied France. He is also an unwilling agent of the Germans, mostly under the command of Col. Kurt von Strohm, and of the French Resistance, under the command of Michelle Dubois (\"Listen very carefully; I shall say this only once\"). Ren is married to aged Edith, who is the worst singer in the world, but he finds that young women find him sexy. Most of the plots include planning the murder of the local commanding German officer, General Erich von Klinkerhoffen, as well as the ownership of a painting called \"The Fallen Madonna with the Big Boobies\"--a painting that everybody would love to get their hands on to sell after the war.

Michael breaks out from Fox River with his brother Lincoln and other convicts. An innocent man is framed for the homicide of the Vice President's brother and scheduled to be executed at a super-max penitentiary, thus it's up to his younger brother to save him with his genius scheme: install himself in the same prison by holding up a bank and, as the final month ticks away, launch the escape plan step-by-step to break the both of them out, with his full-body tattoo acting as his guide; a tattoo which hides the layout of the prison facility and necessary clues vital to the escape.

He was banished from the Irken Empire after nearly destroying his home planet on an early mission. After begging his superiors, the Almighty Tallest Red and Purple, for another chance, they decide to get rid of him once and for all. They trick him into going on a \"secret mission\" to an obscure planet at the edge of the universe, a planet with the unlikely name of Earth. Their trick works, and now ZIM is intent on bringing down the human race. He disguises himself as a schoolboy, and now the only person who can stop him is one kid - Dib Membrane, a somewhat insane paranormal researcher, who sees straight through ZIM's disguise and is intent on stopping his reign of terror. But neither ZIM nor Dib is very good at their job, and what results is everything imaginable, from a giant hamster destroying the city to both ZIM and Dib being turned into bologna meat. The universe's greatest threat, the Irken Empire, is slowly taking over the known universe through, as it seems, sheer dumb luck. An Irken Invader (Ex-Invader, actually), ZIM, who single-handedly destroyed an entire military operation in his past, has returned to his leaders, begging for another chance to give himself a good name. They do- sort of. Actually, they just send him on a joke mission to get him out of the way. They pretend to see his worth, give him a junk robot, and send him off, hoping he'll die on the way. To their surprise, he lives, and actually finds a planet to devastate, which is-what a surprise-Earth. However, he has landed in the wrong place. A paranormal investigator, Dib, has seen through his disguise, and is hot on his trail. It sounds like an average alien story, but it ain't. Did we mention Dib is ten years old, and considered stupid or crazy (though clearly not) by many of his peers? And that ZIM isn't the best invader in the world? Or that neither of them is very good at stopping each other? Or that this show will have you rolling on the floor laughing? If you can get your hands on the Nicktoons channel or the DVDs, you may as well find out... Zim is an alien from the planet Irken, where status is determined by how tall one is. Since Zim is one of the shortest people on Irken (and incompetent to boot), the Almighty Tallest send him on a fake mission by the deranged robot GIR, Zim disguises himself as an ordinary schoolboy in order to gather information about Earth. Only Dib, a pre-teen Mulder wannabee, realizes that Zim is an alien. A short alien bent on conquering Earth poses as a human, and only one paranoid child knows his secret.

As Anne falls into a series of scrapes (and off a roof), makes a bosom friend, searches (and finds) several kindred spirits, Matthew and Marilla discover that their lives have become a great deal richer, now that Anne is at Green Gables. In the early 1900s, elderly Matthew Cuthbert and his spinster sister Marilla Cuthbert live on a farmstead in Avonlea, Prince Edward Island, the house on the property known as Green Gables. To assist with the farm work, they decide to adopt an orphan boy. Through an error, they instead receive a twelve year old orphan girl named Anne Shirley. Anne is outspoken, opinionated and stubborn, but she is also kind, good-hearted and bright. She is extremely self conscious of her looks, especially the fact of her freckles and her red hair. She has a vivid imagination tending toward fantasized romance and tragedy, this a mechanism to escape the harsh life she's endured thus far. Upon meeting Anne, Matthew does not have the heart to send her back. Although the Cuthberts have no practical use for a girl, Matthew talks a begrudging Marilla into keeping Anne, if only on a trial basis. In addition to Marilla, Anne has to win over many of the people of Avonlea, who see an orphan as being nothing but trouble. But in Avonlea, Anne also has many kindred spirits as she calls her dearest friends, including Matthew, classmate Diana Barry, Diana's Aunt Josephine and school teacher Muriel Stacey. Another colleague with whom she has a rocky beginning is classmate Gilbert Blythe, although Gilbert sees Anne in a different light. Through trials and tribulations, Anne does win over those important to her, including Marilla, who ultimately cannot even imagine what life would have been like without Anne. As Anne matures into young womanhood into her late teens, she demonstrates her many talents at Green Gables, at public school and at Queen's College in Charlottetown.
